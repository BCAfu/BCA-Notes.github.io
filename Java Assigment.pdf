           ASSIGNMENT JAVA-1


1)What is Java?
A)Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake


2)Describe brief history of java?
A)James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton developed the Java language project in June 1991. Firstly, it was called "Greentalk"by James Gosling, and with a file extension  .gt. Later on, it was named as Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project
In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.

3)Explain features of Java?
A)Simple 
Object-Oriented
Portable
Platform independent
Secured
Robust
Interpreted. 
Multithreaded
Distributed


4)Differentiate between Java and C.
A)
C	JAVA
C is a Procedural Programming Language.	Java is Object-Oriented
 language.
In C declaration of variables is at the beginning of the block.	We can declare variables 
anywhere.
C does not supports Threading.	Java supports the concept 
of threading.
C supports pointers.	Java does not supports 
pointers.
C is platform dependent.	Java is a platform 
independent.
It follows a top-down approach.	Java follows a bottom-up 
approach.
C does not supports OOPS concept.
C is a compiled language
C is a low-level language	Java supports OOPS  concept
Java is an Interpreted language
JAVA is a high-level language


5)Explain java compilation process.(g)
A)The programs are not compiled into executable files, they are compiled into bytecode which the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) then executes at runtime. Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the javac compiler. The bytecode gets saved on the disk with the file extensionJava program Structure.


6)Write Java program to demonstrate command?
A)
class ComLineEx 
{
 public static void main (String args[]) 
{
 for(inti=0;i<args,length;i++) 
{
 System.out.println("Java is : "+args[i]);
 }
 }
 }
Output:
C:\jdk1.8.0_131\bin>javacComLineEx.java
C:\jdk1.8.0_131\bin>java ComLineEx Simple Object-Oriented Robust Secure
Java is : Simple
Java is : Object-Oriented
Java is : Robust


7)What is variable list the types of variables?
A)Java variable is a piece of memory that can contain a data value. Variables are typically used to store information which your Java program needs to do its job.
Local Variables: A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable
Instance(Gloable) Variables:Instance variables are non-static variables and which are declared outside the class , constructor or block.

Static variables: It is also known as Class variables.These variables are declared similarly as instance variables, and static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.


8)Write a java program to calculate square of number?
A)class Square
{
public static void main(String agrs[])
{
	int n=2;
	{
	System.out.println("Square of the number is"+n*n);
	}	
}
}
Output
Square of the number is 4


9)Explain Java tokens?
A)
 
    
Keywors are 
int,float , if, do, new,char,while,etc
Identifiers
Identifiers are the names of variables, methods, classes, packages and interfaces
Constants
Constants in java are fixed values those are not changed during the Execution of program java supports several types of Constants those are:
Integer Constants
Real Constants
Single Character Constants
String Constants

String
In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values.



10)Explain type casting with example.
A)Casting is a process of changing one type value to another type. There are two types of type casting

Implicit casting: Converting a lower data type into a higher one is called wideningtype/ Implicit casting

Explicit Casting:Converting a higher data type into a lower one is called Narrowing /Explicit Casting.

class Tchange
{
 public static void main(String args[]) 
   { 
     int num= 10; 
     System.out.println("value of int ="+num); 
     double data=num;
     System.out.println("Long value ="+data); 
    }
}
Output
value of int=10
value of long=10.0


11)What is JVM?
A)Java Virtual Machine is an engine that provides run time environment to drive Java code or applications .It converts Java bytecode into machine language .JVM is a part of java run environement(JRE)

12)List different types of decision making statements in Java.
A)If statement
The if statement is a conditional statement in which the tested condition is true then the execution of  a certain section is done.
If-else statement
If-else statement also tests the condition. It executes the if block if condition is true otherwise else block is executed
Nested if..ELSE  Statement
A nested if …else is an statement which contains another if …else. 
if else ladder statement
The if else ladder statement is used to work on multiple conditions. 



13)Give syntax of nested if statement.. 
A)A nested if …else is an statement which contains another 
if …else. If(test condition1 )
{ 
if(test condition2) 
{ 
statement-1;
}   
}


14)What is the difference between print() and println( )? (g)
A)  




15)Explain simple java program line by line.
A)
 
public class HelloWorld : class is keyword used to declare a class in Java HelloWorld is the name of the class
{
public static viod main(String.agrs[ ])//This is the main class method static is a keyword if we declare any method as static ,void is the return type of the method , String args[ ] is used for command line argument
{
System.out.println("hello");//here we are printing hello
}
}

16)Write short note on JVM.
A)Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a engine that provides runtime environment to drive the JavaCode or applications.
It converts Java bytecode into machines language. JVM is a part of Java Run Environment (JRE).
JVM consists of three distinct components:
Class Loader.
Runtime Memory/Data Area.
Execution Engine.

 
 




17)Write a java Program to demonstrate if-else statement.
A)If-else statement
If-else statement also tests the condition. It executes the if block if condition is true otherwise else block is executed
Program
class Ifelse
{
public static void main(String agrs[ ])
 {
  int a=5,b=2;
  if(a>b)
	{
	System.out.println("A is greater");
	}
	else
	{
	System.out.println("B is greater");
	}
 }
}

output:
A is greater 


18)Write a Java program to demonstrate ?: Operator.
A)class Operator
{ 
public static void main( String args[ ] )
{
int number = 3;
String msg = (number % 2 == 0) ? "The number is even!" : "The numbe r is odd!";
System.out.println(msg);
}
}
output
The numbe r is odd


19)Differentiate between while and do while.
A)
 



20)Write a java program to demonstrate switch () case.
A)public class Example {

	{
            switch(i)
	{
            case 0:
                System.out.println("i value is 0");
                break;
             
            case 1:
                System.out.println("i value is 1");
                break;
             
            case 2:
                System.out.println("i value is 2");
                break;
                 
            default:
             System.out.println("i value is greater than 2 and less than 5");
             
            }
 
        }
    }   
}

class Else-if 
{
    public static void main(String[ ] args)
    {
 
                int i = 20;
         if (i < 10)
            System.out.println("i is less than 10\n");
 
                else if (i < 15)
            System.out.println("i is less than 15\n");
 
                else if (i < 20)
            System.out.println("i is less than 20\n");
 
        else
            System.out.println("i is greater than "
                               + "or equal to 20\n");
 
        System.out.println("Outside if-else-if");

System.out.println("i:"+i);
}
}


23)Difference between Java and C++? 
A)
C++ Programming	Java Programming
It support operator overloading.	It does not support operator 
overloading.
It support has template classes.	It does not have template classes
 as in java.

inheritances of classes. 
It supports global variables.	It does not support global 
variables. 

It supports pointers.	It does not use pointers.
It does not support destructor function with a finalize() function.	It has replaced the destructor 
function with a finalize()
